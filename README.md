The credit scoring is to provide lenders with a reliable way to assess the rsik of lending money to a borrower. By using credit scores, lenders can make more informed decisions about whether to approve or deny a loan, and what interest rate to offer to the borrower. The score is usually represented as a three digit number, with higher scores indicating lower credit risk.
